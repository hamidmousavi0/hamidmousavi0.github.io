2025","year":2025,"code_url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/This paper explores higher-resolution video outpainting with extensive content generation. We point out common issues faced by existing methods when attempting to largely outpaint videos: the generation of low-quality content and limitations imposed by GPU memory. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-based method called Infinite-Canvas. It builds upon two core designs. First, instead of employing the common practice of \"single-shot\" outpainting, we distribute the task across spatial windows and seamlessly merge them. It allows us to outpaint videos of any size and resolution without being constrained by GPU memory. Second, the source video and its relative positional relation are injected into the generation process of each window. It makes the generated spatial layout within each window harmonize with the source video. Coupling with these two designs enables us to generate higher-resolution outpainting videos with rich content while keeping spatial and temporal consistency. Infinite-Canvas excels in large-scale video outpainting, e.g., from 512 × 512 to 1152 × 2048 (9×), while producing high-quality and aesthetically pleasing results. It achieves the best quantitative results across various resolution and scale setups. The code is available at https:/github.com/mayuelala/FollowYourCanvas."},{"title":"Grounded Multi-Hop VideoQA in Long-Form Egocentric Videos","authors":["Qirui Chen","Shangzhe Di","Weidi

2025","year":2025,"code_url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/Temporal action localization (TAL) involves dual tasks to classify and localize actions within untrimmed videos. However, the two tasks often have conflicting requirements for features. Existing methods typically employ separate heads for classification and localization tasks but share the same input feature, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel TAL method with Cross Layer Task Decoupling and Refinement (CLTDR). Based on the feature pyramid of video, CLTDR strategy integrates semantically strong features from higher pyramid layers and detailed boundary-aware boundary features from lower pyramid layers to effectively disentangle the action classification and localization tasks. Moreover, the multiple features from cross layers are also employed to refine and align the disentangled classification and regression results. At last, a lightweight Gated Multi-Granularity (GMG) module is proposed to comprehensively extract and aggregate video features at instant, local, and global temporal granularities. Benefiting from the CLTDR and GMG modules, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14, MultiTHUMOS, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS.

To address these limitations, we introduce the virtual dressing (VD) task, which aims to synthesize freely editable human images conditioned on fixed garments and optional user-defined inputs. We further propose a comprehensive affinity metric index (CAMI) to quantify the consistency between generated outputs and reference garments.We present IMAGDressing-v1, which leverages a garment-specific U-Net to integrate semantic features from CLIP and texture features from a VAE. To incorporate these garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net for flexible text-driven scene control, we employ a hybrid attention mechanism composed of frozen self-attention and trainable cross-attention layers. IMAGDressing-v1 seamlessly integrates with extension modules, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, enabling enhanced diversity and controllability.To alleviate data constraints, we introduce the Interactive Garment Pairing (IGPair) dataset, comprising over 300,000 garment–image pairs and a standardized data assembly pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGDressing-v1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlled human image synthesis. The code and model will be available at https:/github.com/muzishen/IMAGDressing."},{"title":"LDP: Generalizing to Multilingual Visual Information Extraction by Language Decoupled

Conventional unsupervised EA approaches attempt to eliminate human intervention but often suffer from accuracy limitations. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), leveraging their capabilities for EA presents a promising direction. However, it introduces new challenges: formulating the LLM-based EA problem and extracting the background knowledge in LLMs to realize EA without human intervention. This paper proposes HLMEA, a novel hybrid language model-based unsupervised EA method. HLMEA formulates the EA task into a filtering and single-choice problem and synergistically integrates small language models (SLMs) and LLMs. Specifically, SLMs filter candidate entities based on textual representations generated from KG triples. Then, LLMs refine this selection to identify the most semantically aligned entities. An iterative self-training mechanism allows SLMs to distill knowledge from LLM outputs, enhancing the EA ability of hybrid language models in subsequent rounds cooperatively. We also conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to evaluate HLMEA's performance. The results demonstrate that HLMEA significantly outperforms unsupervised and even supervised EA baselines, proving its potential for scalable and effective EA across large KGs.

in federated learning (FL) settings. Existing FFS methods focus on capturing the correlations between features and labels. They struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in the face of data distribution heterogeneity among FL clients, and cannot address the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem that arises when a significant portion of clients do not actively participate in FL training. To address these limitations, we propose Federated Causally Invariant Feature Learning (FedCIFL), a novel approach for learning causally invariant features in a privacy-preserving manner. We design a sample reweighting strategy to eliminate spurious correlations introduced by selection bias and iteratively estimate the federated causal effect between each feature and the labels (with the remaining features initially treated as confounders). By iteratively refining the confounding feature set to identify the true confounders, FedCIFL mitigates the impact of limited local data on the accuracy of federated causal effect estimation. Theoretical analysis proves the correctness of FedCIFL under reasonable assumptions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedCIFL against eight state-of-the-art baselines, beating the best-performing approach by 3.19%, 9.07% and 2.65% in terms of average test Accuracy, RMSE and F1 score, respectively. It is a first-of-its-kind FFS approach capable of handling Non-IID and OOD data simultaneously.
