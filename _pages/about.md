I am currently a PhD student at Mälardalen University.
My research has focused on the automatic design of high-performance, compact, robust, and reliable deep learning-based systems for autonomous driving.

My research interests lie in trustworthy, tiny, discriminative and generative deep learning models, with a focus on deploying them on resource-constrained devices.
